CVE-2018-8531	"A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Azure IoT Hub Device Client SDK using MQTT protocol accesses objects in memory, aka ""Azure IoT Device Client SDK Memory Corruption Vulnerability."" This affects Hub Device Client SDK, Azure IoT Edge."	8.8	9.3	CWE-119
CVE-2020-9408	"The Spotfire library component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Spotfire Analytics Platform for AWS Marketplace and TIBCO Spotfire Server contains a vulnerability that theoretically allows an attacker with write permissions to the Spotfire Library, but not ""Script Author"" group permission, to modify attributes of files and objects saved to the library such that the system treats them as trusted. This could allow an attacker to cause the Spotfire Web Player, Analyst clients, and TERR Service into executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the system account that started those processes. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Spotfire Analytics Platform for AWS Marketplace: versions 10.8.0 and below and TIBCO Spotfire Server: versions 7.11.9 and below, versions 7.12.0, 7.13.0, 7.14.0, 10.0.0, 10.0.1, 10.1.0, 10.2.0, 10.3.0, 10.3.1, 10.3.2, 10.3.3, 10.3.4, 10.3.5, and 10.3.6, versions 10.4.0, 10.5.0, 10.6.0, 10.6.1, 10.7.0, and 10.8.0."	8.8	9.0	CWE-276
CVE-2017-14705	DenyAll WAF before 6.4.1 allows unauthenticated remote command execution via TCP port 3001 because shell metacharacters can be inserted into the type parameter to the tailDateFile function in /webservices/stream/tail.php. An iToken authentication parameter is required but can be obtained by exploiting CVE-2017-14706. This affects DenyAll i-Suite LTS 5.5.0 through 5.5.12, i-Suite 5.6, Web Application Firewall 5.7, and Web Application Firewall 6.x before 6.4.1, with On Premises or AWS/Azure cloud deployments.	8.1	9.3	CWE-78
CVE-2018-20655	When receiving calls using WhatsApp for iOS, a missing size check when parsing a sender-provided packet allowed for a stack-based overflow. This issue affects WhatsApp for iOS prior to v2.18.90.24 and WhatsApp Business for iOS prior to v2.18.90.24.	9.8	7.5	CWE-119
CVE-2018-20752	An issue was discovered in Recon-ng before 4.9.5. Lack of validation in the modules/reporting/csv.py file allows CSV injection. More specifically, when a Twitter user possesses an Excel macro for a username, it will not be properly sanitized when exported to a CSV file. This can result in remote code execution for the attacker.	9.8	7.5	CWE-20
